          <h2>There's water on the Moon?</h2>

         NASA recently announced that - for the first time - we’ve confirmed the water molecule, H2O, in sunlit areas of the Moon. This indicates that water is widely distributed across the lunar surface
        <br>
        In the late 2000s, a number of missions including the Indian Space Research Organization’s Chandrayaan-1, and NASA’s Cassini and Deep Impact detected hydration on the lunar surface – but these missions could not determine if the signals were hydroxyl (OH) or water (H2O).

        <p>
        During this same time period, using ultra-high-precision laboratory equipment, scientists found water molecules locked in glasses and minerals in the samples returned by the Apollo missions.
        <br>
        Since then, numerous missions have made similar detections, including our Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and LCROSS missions. The majority of signals come from permanently shadowed regions – craters at the Moon’s poles that never see sunlight. These areas are so cold that water within them gets trapped and can’t evaporate.

          The sun's nearest neighbor may actually host three planets, a new study reports <br>
          
          Astronomers have found evidence of a third planet circling Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf star that lies a mere 4.2 light-years from our solar system. The candidate world, known as Proxima d, is estimated to be just 25% as massive as Earth, making it one of the lightest known exoplanets if it ends up being confirmed.
          
          "The discovery shows that our closest stellar neighbor seems to be packed with interesting new worlds, within reach of further study and future exploration,"
        <br>
        Proxima Centauri is known to host one planet for sure — the roughly Earth-size Proxima b, which completes one orbit every 11 Earth days. That puts Proxima b in the star's "habitable zone," the just-right range of orbital distances where liquid water could exist on a world's surface.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike the Sun, which will evolve into a red giant in 6.5 billion years and reach the end of its life at an age of about 10 billion years, Proxima will stay on the main sequence for another four trillion years due to its low mass and low energy production. Since no star that age has ever been observed (because the universe is only about 13.787 billion years old), the future of Proxima and other low-mass red dwarfs – the most common stars in the universe – is uncertain. Stars with a mass of less than 0.25 solar masses do not evolve into red giants. Astronomers believe that, once they are no longer able to sustain nuclear fusion, these stars will remain small and, as the proportion of helium increases, they will grow hotter to become blue dwarfs. Blue dwarfs are purely hypothetical and their future existence is predicted based on evolutionary models. Toward the end of the blue dwarf phase, Proxima will become considerably more luminous, reaching up to 2.5% of the Sun’s luminosity. Once it runs out of hydrogen fuel, it will evolve into a white dwarf, skipping the red giant phase, and gradually lose all its heat energy.

          The first known interstellar object to visit our solar system, 1I/2017 U1 ‘Oumuamua, was discovered Oct. 19, 2017 by the University of Hawaii’s Pan-STARRS1 telescope, funded by NASA’s Near-Earth Object Observations (NEOO) Program, which finds and tracks asteroids and comets in Earth’s neighborhood. While originally classified as a comet, observations revealed no signs of cometary activity after it slingshotted past the Sun on Sept. 9, 2017 at a blistering speed of 196,000 miles per hour (87.3 kilometers per second). It was briefly classified as an asteroid until new measurements found it was accelerating slightly, a sign it behaves more like a comet.

          The first confirmed object from another star to visit our solar system, this interstellar interloper appears to be a rocky, cigar-shaped object with a somewhat reddish hue. The object, named ‘Oumuamua by its discoverers, is up to one-quarter mile (400 meters) long and highly-elongated—perhaps 10 times as long as it is wide. That aspect ratio is greater than that of any asteroid or comet observed in our solar system to date. While its elongated shape is quite surprising, and unlike objects seen in our solar system, it may provide new clues into how other solar systems formed.
        <br>
        The observations suggest this unusual object had been wandering through the Milky Way, unattached to any star system, for hundreds of millions of years before its chance encounter with our star system.
        
        “For decades we’ve theorized that such interstellar objects are out there, and now―for the first time―we have direct evidence they exist,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington, in November 2017.

        Immediately after its discovery, telescopes around the world, including ESO’s Very Large Telescope in Chile, were called into action to measure the object’s orbit, brightness and color. Urgency for viewing from ground-based telescopes was vital to get the best data
        <br>
        Combining the images from the FORS instrument on the ESO telescope using four different filters with those of other large telescopes, a team of astronomers led by Karen Meech of the Institute for Astronomy in Hawaii found that ‘Oumuamua varies in brightness by a factor of 10 as it spins on its axis every 7.3 hours. No known asteroid or comet from our solar system varies so widely in brightness, with such a large ratio between length and width. The most elongated objects we have seen to date are no more than three times longer than they are wide.
        <br>“This unusually big variation in brightness means that the object is highly elongated: about ten times as long as it is wide, with a complex, convoluted shape,” said Meech. “We also found that it had a reddish color, similar to objects in the outer solar system, and confirmed that it is completely inert, without the faintest hint of dust around it.”
        </p>
        <div id="img_gal8">
          <img src="disc_5.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
        These properties suggest that ‘Oumuamua is dense, composed of rock and possibly metals, has no water or ice, and that its surface was reddened due to the effects of irradiation from cosmic rays over hundreds of millions of years.
        
        A few large ground-based telescopes continued to track the fading object as it receded from our planet. Two of NASA’s space telescopes (Hubble and Spitzer) tracked the object traveling about 85,700 miles per hour (38.3 kilometers per second) relative to the Sun. Its outbound path is about 20 degrees above the plane of planets that orbit the Sun. The object passed Mars’s orbit around Nov. 1 and will pass Jupiter’s orbit in May of 2018. It will travel beyond Saturn’s orbit in January 2019; as it leaves our solar system, ‘Oumuamua will head for the constellation Pegasus.

        <div id="img_gal8">
          <img src="disc_6.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
        Preliminary orbital calculations suggest that the object came from the approximate direction of the bright star Vega, in the northern constellation of Lyra. However, it took so long for the interstellar object to make the journey―even at the speed of about 59,000 miles per hour (26.4 kilometers per second)―that Vega was not near that position when the ‘Oumuamua was there about 300,000 years ago.
        Astronomers estimate that an interstellar object similar to ‘Oumuamua passes through the inner solar system about once per year, but they are faint and hard to spot and have been missed until now. It is only recently that survey telescopes, such as Pan-STARRS1, are powerful enough to have a chance to discover them.
        
        “What a fascinating discovery this is!” said Paul Chodas, manager of the Center for Near-Earth Object Studies at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California. “It’s a strange visitor from a faraway star system, shaped like nothing we’ve ever seen in our own solar system neighborhood.”
        <br>The object was officially named 1I/2017 U1 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), which is responsible for granting official names to bodies in the solar system and beyond. In addition to the technical name, the Pan-STARRS team dubbed it ‘Oumuamua (pronounced oh MOO-uh MOO-uh), which is Hawaiian for “a messenger from afar arriving first.”

          A pair of quakes in 2021 sent seismic waves deep into the Red Planet’s core, giving scientists the best data yet on its size and composition.
          <br>
          
          While NASA retired its InSight Mars lander in December, the trove of data from its seismometer will be pored over for decades to come. By looking at seismic waves the instrument detected from a pair of temblors in 2021, scientists have been able to deduce that Mars’ liquid iron core is smaller and denser than previously thought.
        </p>
        <div id="img_gal8">
          <img src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/1-pia25680-insights-seismometer-1041.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
          Irving noted that the two quakes occurred after the mission had been operating on the Red Planet for well over a full Martian year (about two Earth years), meaning the Marsquake Service – the scientists who initially scrutinize seismographs – had already honed their skills. It also helped that a meteoroid impact caused one of the two quakes; impacts provide a precise location and more accurate data for a seismologist to work with. (Because Mars has no tectonic plates, most marsquakes are caused by faults, or rock fractures, that form in the planet’s crust due to heat and stress.) The quakes’ size was also a factor in the detections.
        <br>
        “These two farside quakes were among the larger ones heard by InSight,” said Bruce Banerdt, InSight’s principal investigator at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California. “If they hadn’t been so big, we couldn’t have detected them.”
        
        One of the challenges in detecting these particular quakes was that they’re in a “shadow zone” – a part of the planet from which seismic waves tend to be refracted away from InSight, making it hard for a quake’s echo to reach the lander unless it is very large. Detecting seismic waves that cross through a shadow zone is exceptionally difficult; it’s all the more impressive that the InSight team did so using just the one seismometer they had on Mars. (In contrast, many seismometers are distributed on Earth.)
        
        “It took a lot of seismological expertise from across the InSight team to tease the signals out from the complex seismograms recorded by the lander,” Irving said.

          <b>Sample Retrieval Lander</b>
          NASA's Sample Retrieval Lander would touch down on Mars and remain in place to receive a diverse collection of scientifically curated samples of Martian rock already collected and cached by NASA's Perseverance rover.
          
          The lander would be the first ever to bring along a rocket — NASA's Mars Ascent Vehicle — and two helicopters, to help achieve the goal of bringing the samples safely to Earth for study. The Mars Ascent Vehicle would launch off the Red Planet, carrying samples into Mars orbit to meet the Earth Return Orbiter provided by ESA (European Space Agency). The orbiter would then take the samples the rest of the way to our planet. The two NASA Sample Recovery Helicopters, modified versions of the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter that Perseverance brought to Mars, would serve as backups for Perseverance's task of bringing sample tubes to the lander.
        </p>
        <div id="img_gal8">
          <img src="msr_2.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>
          In addition, the lander would carry ESA's Sample Transfer Arm to load the sample tubes into the Mars Ascent Vehicle.
          <b>Biggest Lander Ever Sent to Mars</b>
          The payload mass of the lander is double that of the Perseverance rover (1,241 pounds, or 563 kilograms). The lander's hefty cargo would include a rocket, sample transfer arm, and two helicopters. Each landing leg would be roughly the size of a human adult, with the whole lander standing about as tall as a professional basketball player.
